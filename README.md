# PlagiarismChecker

### What is the purpose?
  With the increased popularity of Large Language Models, it becomes crucial for software companies to track the origins of code written by their employees. Using improperly licensed third-party code generated by a language model can lead to significant reputational and financial losses. Code duplication checks against most of the publicly available repositories would avoid these risks and allow detection of problems at earlier stages of the development cycle.
